Founded by Salman Azhar, it started as a volunteer organization with an aim to provide cost-effective and better-served programs for players of all ages. They maintain a low average student-teacher ratio and bring coaching and events to the communities at times convenient for them. In 2018, Bay Area Chess was recognized with the Chess Club of the Year award after several years of growth and expansion into new markets. This success is largely due to Arbisoft’s services which have had a major business impact on Bay Area Chess, allowing them to quickly transition from manual data management systems to automated ones, saving time and money in the process. The Arbisoft team has been instrumental in providing support to BAC, migrating automated data, and revamping their system.
